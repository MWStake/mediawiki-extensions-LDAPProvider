== Extension:LDAPProvider ==

This extension provides a common infratructure to connect to a LDAP resource
and run queries against it.

=== Installation ===

This extension can be installed by creating a composer.local.json file in your MediaWiki's installation directory containing the following (or merging this into your current composer.local.json):

<source lang="json">
{
	"require": {
		"mediawiki/ldap-provider": "dev-master"
	},
	"config": {
		"prefer": "source"
	}
}
</source>

Note that <code>"prefer": "source"</code> causes composer to use a clone of the git repository if it can.

=== Configuration ===

In the simplest case where you have a single LDAP server to query, you need to simply specify your LDAP server and the json file.

Out of the box, LDAPProvider points to the [http://www.forumsys.com/ Forum Systems] [http://www.forumsys.com/tutorials/integration-how-to/ldap/online-ldap-test-server/ online ldap test server] in the included <code>ldapprovider.json</code>.  This is a simple json file that demonstrates the configuration:

<source lang="json">
{
	"server": "ldap.forumsys.com",
	"user": "cn=read-only-admin,dc=example,dc=com",
	"pass": "password",
	"basedn": "dc=example,dc=com"
}
</source>

Other configurations are possible.

 $LDAPProviderDomainConfigs = "/etc/mediawiki/mediawiki.ldap.json";

=== Testing ===

Tests are provided.  These can be run using the following in your MediaWiki's installation directory:

    $ ./tests/phpunit/phpunit.php extensions/LDAPProvider

or, they can be run from within the LDAPProvider directory when it is installed:

    $ composer phpunit
